## Using the Python Arithmetic Calculator

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the calculator.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/arithmetic-calculator.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Move into the project directory using the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd arithmetic-calculator
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - If you don't have Pipenv installed, you can do so using pip (Python's package installer):
     ```bash
     pip install pipenv
     ```
   - Once Pipenv is installed, run the following command to install the project's dependencies:
     ```bash
     pipenv install
     ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:
     ```bash
     pipenv shell
     ```

5. **Run the Program**:
   - Finally, run the program using Python:
     ```bash
     python arithmetic_calculator.py
     ```

### How to Use

1. **Start the Program**: Simply run the calculator in Python by executing the command:
     ```bash
     python arithmetic_calculator.py
     ```

2. **Enter Numbers and Operation**: Input two numbers when prompted and choose the math operation you want to perform (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

3. **See the Result**: The calculator will display the result of your math operation in a clear and easy-to-understand format.

4. **Repeat or Exit**: You can continue doing more calculations as the calculator runs in a loop, or exit anytime you like.

Now you're all set to use the Python Arithmetic Calculator and perform various math operations with ease! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
